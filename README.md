# Instruction
Numbers will appear across the grid in a ramdom order. Remember their positions. Once hidden, tap each tile in ascending order to advance to the next level. Each level adds one more number to remember, and gradually gives you more time to memorize them.

# Note
Inspired by the 2007 memory test software developed by Tetsuro Matsuzawa and his team at Kyoto University for cognitive research, which concluded that young chimpanzees can outperform adult humans in certain rapid working memory tasks.
